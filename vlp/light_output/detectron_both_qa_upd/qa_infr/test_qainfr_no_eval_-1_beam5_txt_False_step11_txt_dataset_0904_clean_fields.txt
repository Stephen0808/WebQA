Q === Approximately many total cents are in a classical characteristic interval of the Dorian scale ?

The (Dorian) scale generated from the chromatic genus is composed of two chromatic tetrachords. A chromatic tetrachord has a characteristic interval that is greater than about half the total interval of the tetrachord, yet not as great as four-fifths of the interval (between about 249 and 398 cents). It says that the characteristic interval is a minor third (approximately 300 cents). If a dorian is two of these and 300 times two is 600, then the answer is 600.

Q === What is the High German consonant shift and in which dialects did it alter a number of consonants ?
Keywords_A === sound change in West Germanic
